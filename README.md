# Read

This repo is created for reproducibility purpose. We provide two sets of code: 

1). A complete reproduction of the scores seen in the paper (by loading in saved previously sampled partitions); 

2). A complete system to sample new partitions and generate new captions.

The system we share here only pertains to CUB dataset, because it is smaller and easier to process.

We do plan to make available both our CUB and MSCOCO code base upon acceptance.
